### In The `Digit_Mnist.ipynb` I Used `sklearn` Library To Use KNN Method To Train Our Model , Then I Tried Training 45 SVM's =))  ( one for each pair ) <br> to see if it works or not.
<br>

### in The Second Notebook `NN_Digit_Mnist.ipynb` I UseD `Keras` API to Created `CNN` Networks To Train My Model And As You Can See I Reached `0.9980 ` Accuracy On Train And `0.9908` On Validation.
