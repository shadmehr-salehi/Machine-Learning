## In The `Digit_Mnist.ipynb` We First Use KNN Method To Train Our Model , Then We Try Training 45 SVM's `=))`  ( one for each pair ) <br> to see if it works or not.
<br>

## in The Second Notebook `NN_Digit_Mnist.ipynb` We Use `CNN` Networks To Train Our Model And As You Can See We Reached `0.9980 ` Accuracy On Train And `0.9908` On Validation.
